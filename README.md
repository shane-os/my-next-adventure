## UX (User Experience):
#### Project Goals:
 * The aim of this project is to design and build a website allowing users to research tourist attractions in their chosen area.
 * Users will be able to create their own unique accounts and post reviews on featured tourist attractions. This will assist other users in researching potential places to visit on their next vacation.

#### User Goals:
 * Research attractions for their chosen area.
 * Determine the appropriateness of the attraction based on their criteria. (e.g. Free, Suitable for Children, etc.)
 * See reviews posted by other site users.
 * Provide helpful reviews to other users.

#### User Stories:
 * As a user, I would like to find a list of attractions for my chosen area.
 * As a user, I would like to view honest, personal feedback of other users about each site to help make a better informed decision.
 * As a user, I would like to examine which attractions meet my criteria. (e.g. Free, Pre-Booking Required, etc.)
 * As a user, I would like to help other users by providing my own reviews of attractions.

#### Site Owner Goals:
 * As a site owner, I wish to provide information on various attractions in the user's chosen area.
 * As a site owner, I want to allow users to easily filter attractions based on specific criteria to find applicable attractions.
 * As a site owner, I would like to build a site allowing users to give reviews on attractions.

#### User Requirements:
 * Attraction search and filter function delivers correct results promptly.
 * Users are able to create accounts and log into their accounts as required.
 * Accounts created and user details provided are to be secure.
 * Users are able to post reviews on attractions
 * Internal site links direct users as expected.

#### User Expectations:
 * Attraction information and images are appropriate and shown in an ordered fashion.
 * Attraction reviews are easy to publish and view.
 * Users can contact the site owner if an issue occurs.

## Site Layout & Design:
#### Wireframes:
Initially I set out my ideas for the site using pen and paper. Following a few changes, I proceeded to create wireframes using the Balsamiq Wireframe application. The three wireframes have been stored in a PDF format at the following locations:

 * Mobile
 * Desktop
 * Tablet
 
#### Colour Scheme:
For this project, I have chosen to use striking and varied colours to represent the numerous attractions available. Different colours will be used to indicate the style of the attraction on offer. E.g. Red as a colour of excitement will be used for theme parks and similar venues. The main colours chosen to be used in this project are:

 * #000000 - Black - Text
 * #538D22 - Maximum Green - Attractions involving nature, outdoors events
 * #4F74E3 - Royal Blue Light - Knowledge and sea-life based attractions such as museums, boat tours amd aquariums
 * #F41101 - Red - Energic and exciting attractions including sporting events and theme parks
 * #997748 Metallic Sunburst (Brown) - Historical buildings and landmarks including castles and palaces
