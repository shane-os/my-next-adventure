## UX (User Experience):
#### Project Goals:
 * The aim of this project is to design and build a website allowing users to research tourist attractions in their chosen area.
 * Users will be able to create their own unique accounts and post reviews on featured tourist attractions. This will assist other users in researching potential places to visit on their next vacation.

 * Determine the appropriateness of the attraction based on their criteria. (e.g. Free, Suitable for Children, etc.)
 * See reviews posted by other site users.
 * Provide helpful reviews to other users.

#### User Stories:
 * As a user, I would like to find a list of attractions for my chosen area.
 * As a user, I would like to view honest, personal feedback of other users about each site to help make a better informed decision.
 * As a user, I would like to examine which attractions meet my criteria. (e.g. Free, Pre-Booking Required, etc.)
 * As a user, I would like to help other users by providing my own reviews of attractions.

#### Site Owner Goals:
 * As a site owner, I wish to provide information on various attractions in the user's chosen area.
 * As a site owner, I want to allow users to easily filter attractions based on specific criteria to find applicable attractions.
 * As a site owner, I would like to build a site allowing users to give reviews on attractions.
